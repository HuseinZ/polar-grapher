# Welcome to my polar graphing program
# This file defines the program settings and the functions to be drawn
# lines beginning with # are comments and are ignored by program
# if an option is left out, the default will be used

# set window to fullscreen
# windowed is default
#fullscreen

# set window/view size
# size 700 is default
size 530

# set recording frameskip and destination folder
# 1 will record every frame, 2 will record every other frame, 3 will record every third frame, etc as PNG
# 0 is default and disables recording
# folder must exist before attempting to save recording there
# record 0 frames

# define a function
#function        200 * sin(4 *theta / 9)

# set draw speed
# this is how many points are drawn per frame at 60 fps
# draw_speed 100 is default
# draw_speed 0 will draw the function instantly
draw_speed       0

# set RGB color
# Cyan is default
color            255 0 0

# set maximum theta value
# theta_max 50*pi is default
theta_max        20*pi

# set theta increment (change in theta per point)
# theta_increment pi/3000 is default and produces a solid line for most functions
# larger values (like pi/100) will yield dots instead of a solid line
# will also affect draw speed
theta_increment  pi/3000

# set line width
# 0 = thinnest, default
# 1 = medium
# 2 = widest
line_width       1

# rotation per frame
rotation_speed  pi/10000 

# end function definition
#end
